1. First, npm install react-router and react-router-dom. You need both. 
2. Import what you need to use inside the file your using it. 
    import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom' 👈🏽 This is usually the case. 
3. In the case of this practice. A single route needed to be defined outside of the rest of the app which all lands on the home route.
   So the entire app is wrapped inside the BrowserRouter followed by a seperate route defined as the contact page. 
   Otherwise, the usual proccess is that each component has it's own route and all routes get defined within the App.js file like this:

import "./App.css";
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <div className="App">
        <Navbar />
        <Routes>
          <Route exact path="/" element={<Home />}></Route>
          <Route exact path="/services" element={<Services />}></Route>
          <Route exact path="/our-work" element={<Work />}></Route>
          <Route exact path="/squarespace" element={<Squarespace />}></Route>
          <Route exact path="/seo" element={<Seo />}></Route>
          <Route exact path="/branding" element={<Branding />}></Route>
          <Route exact path="/about" element={<About />}></Route>
          <Route exact path="/contact" element={<Contact />}></Route>
          <Route exact path="/workshops" element={<Workshops />}></Route>
          <Route exact path="/success" element={<Success />}></Route>
          <Route exact path="/credits" element={<Credits />}></Route>
        </Routes>
        <Footer/>
      </div>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;


4. The alternative to using <Link> to navigate to a page is to use navigate. 
                import {useNavigate} from "react-router-dom";
                const navigate = useNavigate();
                <button onClick={() =>{navigate("/");}}>Go to Homepage</button>


**Key Notes**
<Navlink/> Won't refresh the browser when clicked. <Link/> will. <Navlink> is typically used for navigation links. 
<Navigate/> Will automatically navigate whenever it's called. i.e. 
                                <div>
                                <Navigate to="/contact"/> 👈 This page will auto navigate to the contact page no matter what. 
                                About
                                </div>
<Navigate/> is best used as a re-direct.
